const :

	const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

Var :
   
         The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.

         The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.


let  :
    
        The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.

        The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
